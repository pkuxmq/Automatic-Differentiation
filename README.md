# Automatic-Differentiation
Homework for Convex Analysis and Optimization Methods
## Function
The program provides interface for building computational graph, building automatic differentiation computational graph and computing the results for a given expression DAG.  
The program also include a test sample for function y = (sin(x1 + 1) + cos(x2)) * tan(log(x3)) + (sin(x2 + 1) + cos(2x2) * exp(1 + sin(x3))

## Environment
Linux  
Test sample: run the excutable file 'test' with three arguments (x1, x2, x3), such as ./test 2 2 2.
